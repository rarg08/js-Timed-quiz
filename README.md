# js-Timed-quiz
a js themed quiz that runs a timer to complete and saves and displays the scores of the people that took it
 in this files are the projet to create a timed quiz that stores the scores of the users with a nickname or initials and saves them to local, you can also clean the storage

 in this project I applied what I learned about html, css and js, and how to use 1 or more in a single page calling the scripts
 i also had to learn how to do the flashing for the feedback, which was a part of css I didn't consider existed.

this was a very nice challenge that helped me with my investigation skills and how to pool and combine resources to obtain the desider output by using google, youtube tutorials and chatGPT to help with the snippet skeletons by prompting what I needed to do in JS and then 
thinkering the answer.

thanks for checking my project out, I really hope you liked it!
